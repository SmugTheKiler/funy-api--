# Functions

This api can do.. not a lot of things

## List

- Creates profiles for users
When the user registrates, the API creates a profile int he database (read data.md for more info about it) and stores pretty much everything it needs.
Including their IP adress as their ID, their token, their total requests, and the specific end points they use the most.

- Uses token generation
Users get a uniqe token when they registrate, which can only be one per IP. This will let them use the api from that IP.

- End Points
yeah.... it has end points like an API should. Also has some settings (Read settings.md for more about that.)

- There's probably  more stuff but I forgot..

## Why did I make this?

I created this project because I was bored af, and my house didn't have internet for weeks. Had nothing to do at my computer, so I decided
to continue this littile project that I started earlier (It was almost nothing like it is now though.) Got pretty far, and decided to host it.

Right now this is a private project and I am not even sure why I am writing this but it might be open source some day, you never know.
For some reason I hate it when poeple keep their projects private, like whats the point?! And then I keep em private because I hate it 
when people steal the code - Though I do.. anyway, I just don't like it. But it still sort of feels good.

## ALL INFROMATION CAN BE FOUND IN `INFO` FOLDER

## Things this thing can do

- It has like, a lot a lot of settings
- It is very extendable 
- Its literally a tempalate, so adding on to it isn't very hard
- If you don't know how to add something, theres probably a guide for it. If not make an issue or something

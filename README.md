# funy-api
This is an API that I made because I was bored and had no wifi..

## ALL INFROMATION CAN BE FOUND IN `INFO` FOLDER

## Things this thing can do

- It has like, a lot a lot of settings
- It is very extendable 
- Its literally a tempalate, so adding on to it isn't very hard
- If you don't know how to add something, theres probably a guide for it. If not make an issue or something

- It stores all the data in a .json file, you can change that, that will require some code editing though. You don't need to change it unless you're going to go big, and have a lot of users and data to keep track of.


Sadly, even though this is kind of a small project its literally my best one :) Thanks for at least reading this, have a good day.

Please don't forget about me in 23 minutes ! 

Love u :)
